# Security Testing — Structured Application Pentesting Methodology

## Activation
When this skill activates, output:
"Running security testing protocol..."

## Overview

This skill provides a structured penetration testing methodology for web applications, APIs, and Node.js services. It follows a phased approach: Reconnaissance → Attack Surface Mapping → Automated Scanning → Manual OWASP Analysis → API Security Testing → Reporting.

**Core principles:**
- **Safety first** — Never use destructive payloads against production. Test against staging/dev environments unless explicitly authorized.
- **Evidence-based** — Every finding needs a reproduction path, not just a theory.
- **Scope-aware** — Stay within the target's boundaries. Respect `robots.txt`, rate limits, and auth boundaries.
- **Report-ready** — Every finding is documented with severity, evidence, and remediation.

---

## Phase 0: Setup & Prerequisites

### 0.1 Load Supporting Skills
Load these skills if available:
- `code-review` — for static analysis of security-sensitive code paths
- `debugging` — if something breaks during testing

### 0.2 Identify Target
Before testing, establish:
- [ ] Target URL(s) and environment (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Source code location (if available — enables deeper analysis)
- [ ] Auth credentials (if authorized testing)
- [ ] Scope boundaries (what's in/out of scope)

### 0.3 Ensure Security Tools Are Installed
Security tools (nuclei, trufflehog, snyk) are on-demand only — NOT pre-installed at startup.
Run the following to install them if missing:

```bash
node scripts/ensure-tools.mjs --manifest config/tools-security.json
```

If the manifest is not found at config/tools-security.json, the tools may already be installed
from a previous session. Check for each binary directly.

### 0.4 Create Working Directory
```
mkdir -p data/reports/security/YYYY-MM-DD-targetname/
```
All findings, logs, and reports go here.

---

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance

### 1.1 Tech Stack Detection
Identify what the target is built with:
- Read `package.json`, `next.config.js`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` for stack clues
- Check `<meta>` tags, HTTP headers, and cookie names for framework signatures
- Look for `X-Powered-By`, `Server`, and other revealing headers using `webfetch`

**Output**: Tech stack inventory — languages, frameworks, databases, third-party services.

### 1.2 Endpoint Enumeration
If source code is available:
- Grep for route/API path definitions: `app.get(`, `router.post(`, `api/`, `route.ts`, `server.action`
- Look for API route files with glob: `**/api/**/route.{ts,js}` or `**/pages/api/**/*.{ts,js}`
- Check for middleware chains that reveal auth boundaries
- Document all discovered endpoints grouped by auth requirement

If source is NOT available (black-box):
- Use webfetch on common paths: `/api`, `/health`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/.well-known/`
- Probe for exposed endpoints by URL convention

### 1.3 Dependency Vulnerability Scan
```bash
# npm audit for current project deps
cd <project-dir> && npm audit

# snyk for deeper analysis (if configured)
snyk test --all-projects

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

**Output**: List of known CVEs affecting dependencies, sorted by severity.

### 1.4 Secret Scanning
```bash
# Scan git history for committed secrets
trufflehog filesystem --directory=<project-dir> --results=verified

# Scan current codebase for hardcoded credentials
trufflehog filesystem --directory=<project-dir>
```

Also manually check:
- `.env` files (should never be committed — check `.gitignore`)
- Hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens in source code
- Exposed credentials in client-side code (Next.js public runtime config, etc.)

---

## Phase 2: Attack Surface Mapping

### 2.1 Route & Auth Boundary Map
Document every route and its auth requirement:

```
┌──────────────┬────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Route        │ Method         │ Auth Required    │ Input Params │
├──────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ /api/users   │ GET, POST      │ JWT (admin)      │ query, body  │
│ /api/login   │ POST           │ None             │ body         │
│ ...          │                │                  │              │
└──────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**Key questions:**
- Are protected routes actually guarded? Can I call an authenticated endpoint without a token?
- Is auth checked at the route level, middleware level, or both?
- Are there any routes that skip auth middleware? (common bug: route ordering)

### 2.2 Data Flow Tracing
For each critical data flow (login, payment, data mutation):
1. Trace from user input → server processing → storage/response
2. Identify validation boundaries
3. Look for trust boundaries — where does user-controlled data cross into a different trust level?

### 2.3 Third-Party Service Inventory
Identify external services the app talks to:
- Grep for URLs in API calls, webhook URLs, callback URLs
- Check environment configs for SERVICE_URL, API_ENDPOINT, etc.
- Look for OAuth provider configurations

---

## Phase 3: Automated Scanning

### 3.1 Nuclei Scan
Run template-based vulnerability scanning against web targets:
```bash
# Basic scan against target URL
tools/security/nuclei.exe -u <target-url> -o data/reports/security/nuclei-results.txt

# Focused scan: OWASP Top 10 templates
tools/security/nuclei.exe -u <target-url> -t ~/nuclei-templates/http/cves/ -o data/reports/security/nuclei-cves.txt

# Tech stack detection
tools/security/nuclei.exe -u <target-url> -t ~/nuclei-templates/http/technologies/ -o data/reports/security/tech-stack.txt
```

**Interpreting results**: Each finding includes a severity (critical/high/medium/low/info), description, and reference URL. Verified findings go into the report.

### 3.2 Dependency Scan
Already done in Phase 1 — review results with focus on:
- Critical/High severity CVEs with known exploits
- Outdated major versions with security implications
- Transitive dependencies with vulnerabilities

### 3.3 Security Headers Check
```bash
# Check HTTP security headers via webfetch or curl
webfetch <target-url>

# Check specifically for:
```

Check for these headers:
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) — missing or short max-age
- `Content-Security-Policy` — missing or overly permissive
- `X-Content-Type-Options` — missing (MIME sniffing risk)
- `X-Frame-Options` or `frame-ancestors` CSP — missing (clickjacking)
- `Referrer-Policy` — missing or too permissive
- `Permissions-Policy` / `Feature-Policy` — missing
- `Set-Cookie` flags — missing `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`

### 3.4 CORS Misconfiguration Check
```bash
# Test CORS headers with webfetch by checking Access-Control-Allow-Origin
# Also check for:
```

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with credentials — dangerous
- Reflecting `Origin` header in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` — wide open
- Excessive methods in `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
- Credentials allowed from arbitrary origins

## Phase 4: Manual OWASP Top 10 Analysis (2021)

For each category, perform the listed checks against the source code AND live endpoints.

### A01: Broken Access Control

**What to check:**
- [ ] **IDOR** (Insecure Direct Object Reference): Can user A access user B's data by changing an ID in the URL/body? Check patterns like `/api/users/:id`, `/api/orders/:orderId`
- [ ] **Privilege escalation**: Can a regular user access admin endpoints? Send a non-admin token to `/api/admin/*`
- [ ] **Missing function-level access control**: Are admin-only actions gated? Check if role/permission checks exist on the server
- [ ] **Mass assignment**: Can users set fields they shouldn't? Check for `req.body` spread into DB models without filtering
- [ ] **Path traversal**: Are file paths sanitized? Check for `../../../etc/passwd` patterns in file download endpoints

**Code patterns to grep:**
```
findById|findByPk -> check if scoped to the authenticated user
req.params.id|req.query.id -> check if the user owns this resource
role|permission|isAdmin -> check where these are actually enforced (server, not client)
```

### A02: Cryptographic Failures

**What to check:**
- [ ] **HTTP instead of HTTPS** — are there any pages/routes served over plain HTTP?
- [ ] **Weak password hashing**: What algorithm? bcrypt? argon2? plain MD5/SHA1?
- [ ] **Sensitive data in transit**: Are API calls over HTTPS? Check for mixed content
- [ ] **Sensitive data in URLs**: Passwords, tokens, or PII in query strings or `req.params`
- [ ] **Weak JWT**: Check algorithm — is it `HS256`? Can the server accept `none` algorithm?
- [ ] **Hardcoded crypto keys**: Keys, secrets, or certificates in source code
- [ ] **Insufficient entropy**: UUID v1, timestamp-based tokens, sequential IDs for sensitive resources

### A03: Injection

**What to check:**
- [ ] **SQL/NoSQL injection**: Are raw queries used? Check for string interpolation in DB queries, `$where` in MongoDB
- [ ] **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, stored, DOM-based
  - `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML`, `v-html` patterns
  - User input rendered without escaping in templates
  - Search fields that reflect input without encoding
- [ ] **Command injection**: `exec()`, `spawn()`, `child_process` with user input
- [ ] **Prototype pollution**: `Object.assign({}, req.body)`, spread operator on user data
- [ ] **Eval/indirect injection**: `eval()`, `Function()`, `setTimeout(string)` patterns

**Code patterns to grep:**
```
exec\(|spawn\(|child_process -> command injection risk
innerHTML|dangerouslySetInnerHTML|v-html -> XSS risk
SELECT.*\+|INSERT.*\${|`SELECT -> SQL injection risk
\.exec\(.*req\.|\.query\(.*req\. -> SQL injection risk
```

### A04: Insecure Design

**What to check:**
- [ ] **No rate limiting** on auth endpoints — brute force possible?
- [ ] **No account lockout** — unlimited login attempts?
- [ ] **Predictable password reset** — is the reset token guessable? Time-based? Sequential?
- [ ] **Missing input validation** — what happens with excessively large inputs, negative numbers, type mismatches?
- [ ] **Business logic flaws** — can I place an order with a negative quantity? Can I apply a discount code multiple times? Can I bypass a step in a workflow?
- [ ] **Missing CSRF tokens** on state-changing endpoints (if not using SameSite cookies)

### A05: Security Misconfiguration

**What to check:**
- [ ] **Debug/verbose error messages** enabled in production — stack traces exposed?
- [ ] **Default credentials** still in place?
- [ ] **Directory listing enabled** — can I browse the file system?
- [ ] **Unnecessary open ports** — check what the app exposes
- [ ] **Outdated software** — any known-vulnerable versions of frameworks detected?
- [ ] **Information disclosure** — server version headers, verbose error messages, comment leaks

### A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components

**What to check:**
- [ ] **npm audit results** — any critical/high severity findings?
- [ ] **Outdated major frameworks** — Next.js 13 vs 14 vs 15 security fixes
- [ ] **Unmaintained dependencies** — last updated >2 years ago?
- [ ] **Known CVE check** — search for CVEs in critical dependencies
- [ ] **Lockfile integrity** — does `package-lock.json` match `package.json`?

### A07: Identification & Authentication Failures

**What to check:**
- [ ] **Weak password policy** — minimum length? complexity requirements?
- [ ] **Session fixation** — is the session ID changed after login?
- [ ] **JWT issues**: 
  - Does the server verify the signature?
  - Does the server check `alg: none`?
  - Is the token expiry enforced?
  - Are tokens revoked on logout?
- [ ] **Session timeout** — does the session expire appropriately?
- [ ] **Credential stuffing protection** — rate limiting on login?
- [ ] **MFA** — is it available? optional or required?

### A08: Software & Data Integrity Failures

**What to check:**
- [ ] **Supply chain risk**: Are dependencies pinned to exact versions? Lockfile checked in?
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline security**: Are there secrets in CI configs? Is the deploy secure?
- [ ] **Insecure deserialization**: `JSON.parse` on untrusted data? `eval`?
- [ ] **CDN/script integrity**: Are external scripts loaded with `integrity` hashes (SRI)?

### A09: Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

**What to check:**
- [ ] **Failed login attempts logged?**
- [ ] **Sensitive data in logs** — passwords, tokens, PII in log output?
- [ ] **Audit trail** — are destructive actions (deletes, privilege changes) logged?
- [ ] **Alerting** — is there any mechanism to detect brute force, scraping, or abuse?
- [ ] **Error handling** — do errors expose stack traces or sensitive context?

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**What to check:**
- [ ] **URL fetch from user input**: Does the app fetch a URL provided by the user?
- [ ] **Internal network access**: Can the user make the server request internal IPs (169.254.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x)?
- [ ] **Cloud metadata endpoints**: Can the user reach `169.254.169.254` (AWS/GCP/Azure metadata)?
- [ ] **Open redirects**: URL parameters that redirect without validation

**Code patterns to grep:**
```
fetch\(.*req\.|axios\(.*req\.|request\(.*req\. -> SSRF if URL comes from user input
redirect\(|res.redirect -> open redirect if URL from params
```

---

## Phase 5: API Security Testing

### 5.1 Authentication & Token Testing
For every authenticated endpoint, test:
- [ ] **No token**: Call endpoint without auth header → should return 401
- [ ] **Expired token**: Call with an expired JWT → should return 401
- [ ] **Invalid token**: Call with a tampered/malformed token → should return 401
- [ ] **Wrong user token**: User A's token on User B's resource → should return 403
- [ ] **Weak token algorithm**: Try sending JWT with `alg: none`

### 5.2 Input Validation Testing
For every endpoint with parameters:
- [ ] **Type coercion**: Send string where number expected, null where object expected
- [ ] **Boundary values**: Max length, very large arrays, negative numbers
- [ ] **SQL injection payloads** in string fields: `' OR 1=1 --`, `admin'--`
- [ ] **XSS payloads** in string fields: `<script>alert(1)</script>`
- [ ] **Prototype pollution**: `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype` in JSON body
- [ ] **Mass assignment**: Extra fields in JSON body that shouldn't be settable

### 5.3 Rate Limiting & Abuse Testing
- [ ] **Brute force protection**: Rapid login attempts — at what point are they blocked?
- [ ] **API rate limits**: How many requests before 429? Are limits per-IP or per-user?
- [ ] **Resource exhaustion**: Large payloads, pagination abuse (`?limit=100000`), recursive queries

### 5.4 Response Structure Consistency
- [ ] **Error responses**: Do error responses leak stack traces, SQL queries, or internal paths?
- [ ] **Excessive data**: Does the API return more fields than the UI needs (over-fetching)?
- [ ] **Consistent format**: Are all endpoints consistent in their response envelope?

---

## Phase 6: Authentication & Authorization Deep Dive

### 6.1 Session Management Review
- [ ] **Cookie attributes**: `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`, `Path` set correctly?
- [ ] **Session ID entropy**: Are session IDs predictable or sequential?
- [ ] **Session lifetime**: Absolute timeout vs idle timeout
- [ ] **Post-logout invalidation**: Is the session/token actually invalidated on logout?
- [ ] **Concurrent sessions**: Multiple logins allowed? Limit?

### 6.2 JWT Deep Dive
If the app uses JWT:
- [ ] **Algorithm verification**: Test with `alg: none`, `alg: HS256` when it should be `RS256`
- [ ] **Key confusion**: If RS256, does it accept the public key as an HMAC secret?
- [ ] **Claims review**: Check `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, `iss`, `aud` — are they properly validated?
- [ ] **Sensitive data in payload**: Is PII or role info encoded in the JWT payload?
- [ ] **Token storage**: localStorage? sessionStorage? httpOnly cookie?

### 6.3 OAuth / SSO Review (if applicable)
- [ ] **Redirect URI validation**: Can redirect URI be manipulated?
- [ ] **State parameter**: Is CSRF prevention via `state` parameter used?
- [ ] **Token leakage**: Are tokens passed in URL fragments or referrer headers?
- [ ] **Scope validation**: Does the app validate the scope of the received token?

## Phase 7: Reporting

### 7.1 Finding Severity

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Direct compromise — RCE, auth bypass, data breach | Stop testing, report immediately |
| **HIGH** | Significant risk — SQLi, privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure | Must fix before deployment |
| **MEDIUM** | Moderate risk — XSS, CSRF, information disclosure, missing headers | Should fix |
| **LOW** | Minor risk — verbose errors, missing cookie flags, weak CSP | Fix if time allows |
| **INFO** | Informational — tech stack disclosure, non-critical findings | Note for awareness |

- Store report to `data/reports/security/YYYY-MM-DD-targetname/report.md`
- If findings are critical/high, alert immediately
- Include raw tool output files in the report directory

---

## Escalation

If any **CRITICAL** finding is discovered (RCE, auth bypass with direct compromise, exposed database credentials):
1. Stop testing immediately
2. Report to the user with full reproduction steps
3. Do NOT continue testing until the user acknowledges the finding

If a tool fails or produces unreliable results:
- Try an alternative approach from a different phase
- Document what was attempted and why it failed
- If the testing process is blocked, report the blocker

## Self-Verification Checklist

Before finalizing a report:
- [ ] Every endpoint in scope was tested
- [ ] Auth boundaries verified (not just assumed)
- [ ] Dependency scan completed and reviewed
- [ ] Secret scan completed (trufflehog on repo)
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 check — each category reviewed
- [ ] Security headers checked
- [ ] Every finding includes reproduction steps
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered out
- [ ] Report stored to `data/reports/security/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- [ ] CRITICAL findings reported immediately if any
