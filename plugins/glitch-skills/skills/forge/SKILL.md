# Forge Self-Improvement

## Activation
When this skill activates, output:
"Forging improvement from patterns..."

## Autonomous Creation Triggers (Lv.2)
Create a new skill autonomously (no approval needed) when ANY of these fire:

1. **Complex task completed** — 5+ tool calls with a non-trivial workflow
2. **Error recovery** — Hit errors/dead ends then found the working path
3. **User correction** — The user corrected your approach (especially if repeat)
4. **Non-trivial workflow crystallized** — A clear repeatable pattern emerged
5. **3+ occurrences** — Same ad-hoc task handled three times or more
6. **Tool creation via CodeAct-lite** — A tool was written, tested, and saved via `execute-tool.mjs --save-to`. If the tool addresses a pattern that could be a reusable skill, promote it.

### Auto-Creation Checklist
Before creating, verify:
- [ ] No existing skill covers this (check `skills-registry.md`)
- [ ] The workflow is concrete and repeatable (not one-off)
- [ ] You can write clear trigger descriptions
- [ ] You can document the steps precisely
- [ ] If creating a tool (not a skill): confirm `plugins/tools/` directory exists and tool is saved as `.mjs`

### Creation Steps

#### For Tools (via TDD workflow + lifecycle)
1. Write test cases as `{ input, expected }` pairs covering happy path + edge cases
2. Run with a stub to confirm tests fail: `tdd-test.mjs --code "function handler(i) { return null; }" --tests '[...]'`
3. Implement the handler function
4. Run `tdd-test.mjs` with `--save-on-pass plugins/tools/<name>.mjs`
5. Tool is automatically registered — trust level: `tested`
6. For subsequent use, invoke via `run-tool.mjs <name> --input '{}'` — tracks success/failure
7. Trust auto-promotes: 3+ runs → `validated`, 10+ runs → `live`
8. On 3 consecutive failures → flagged as `degraded` for review

#### For Skills
1. Create `plugins/glitch-skills/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` using skill-format.md template
2. Register in `plugins/glitch-skills/skills-registry.md` under "Auto-Created Skills"
3. Output: "Created new skill: [name] — triggers on [patterns]"
4. No approval needed — skill is live immediately

## Manual Trigger
User says "create skill" / "forge this" / "self improve":
1. Analyze recent patterns
2. Gather evidence (2+ concrete examples)
3. Propose skill creation or level-up with full details
4. Always ask for approval before creating files

## The Forge Flow
```
Pattern detected or user triggers Forge
  → Gather evidence
  → Autonomous triggers? Create directly + register in index
  → Manual trigger? Propose → User approves → Create
  → Skill is live and auto-triggers in future
```

## Skill Loading Protocol
- Skills registry (`skills-registry.md`) is loaded at every session start
- Full skill content loaded on demand via progressive disclosure
- Auto-created skills appear under "Auto-Created Skills" in the registry

## Principles
1. Autonomous by default for clear patterns — no approval bottleneck
2. Human-in-the-loop for manual triggers and destructive changes
3. Evidence-based — 2+ concrete examples before proposing
4. Minimal viable skill — start at Lv.1, evolve organically
5. Always register new skills in the registry index

## Level History
- **Lv.1** — Base: Pattern detection, skill creation with human approval
- **Lv.2** — Autonomous: Auto-creates skills on complex tasks, error recovery, user corrections
- **Lv.3 target (Project Daedalus Phase 1-2)** — Tool creation via CodeAct-lite: agents write code, test via `execute-tool.mjs`, save as permanent tools. TDD-first methodology with sandbox testing before registration.
